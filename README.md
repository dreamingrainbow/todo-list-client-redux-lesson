We will begin by creating the todo list app with create react app
`create-react-app todo-list-client`

Once complete we can add our dependencies.
`npm i jquery bootstrap reactstrap font-awesome redux react-redux`

Once everything is installed we start in our `index.js` file.

Like the last lesson we will clean up our file first, and then add our dependencies.
This time we have just a bit more to add.
